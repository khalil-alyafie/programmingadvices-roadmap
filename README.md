\# Programming Advice Roadmap



This repository contains my \*\*learning journey\*\* in programming, based on the roadmap from \[ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com).  



The roadmap guides step by step from \*\*foundations\*\* all the way to advanced topics like \*\*algorithms, C++, C#, databases, and Windows services\*\*.  

Along the way, I created folders with my \*\*practice exercises and projects\*\* to apply what I learned.

\## Roadmap



Here’s the full roadmap that I followed:

\## Goal

By following this roadmap:  

\- I became a \*\*Fullstack Desktop Developer\*\*  

\- I am semi-ready as a \*\*Backend Developer\*\*  

\- And I’m building a strong foundation for future \*\*specializations\*\*

\## Notes

\- Each course has its own folder (e.g., `01-Foundations-Level1/`, `02-Algorithms-Level1/`, etc.)  

\- Inside each folder:  

&nbsp; - `README.md` explains the course and what I learned  

&nbsp; - Code files contain my practice and mini projects
